hello! i know it's a little unorthodox to drop this in GitHub but I do need to have 2 text files here for a class so here's some poetry 
I wrote about studying abroad in LA. Hope you like it!

刮风,
my mother warns me,
要穿衣服 she chides again.
日月潭,
I throw my hand out to the wind,
eyes up to the 山顶 , cloud-capped, soft blue.
I don’t understand, I don’t understand,
我就是不用穿。

Scrape is
a knee against gravel
golden-red pus scabbing over

changkul against soil, rocks 
dustclouds puffing up

how my friends made their 3D art projects
or my piano 20th-century dissonance

counting money - “scraping by”
begging friends for help - “I scraped this together”

And come on, I’m already wearing clothes, what you want is for me to wear a sweater, 
but it’s not even cold, this wind is barely harsh, and Mom, I like the cold, 
I sleep better over my two-week 忠孝东路, but despite all of that, and I do tend to ramble but here I am, 
nine years later atop Griffith Observatory, 17 year old in college, in LA, alone, and—

刮风,
I end up saying. 
Concisely, for once. 
Standing tall on the 山顶，
洛杉矶天空是无云的，
“This is what my mother meant,
when she said 刮风” 
I say to my college friends
who think I’m shaking because I am cold.
No, again, it’s not cold, not really,
but up here
the wind does scrape at me, 
redden cheeks, 
beat against trees and make them bend,
its dissonance ringing in my ears.

我需要穿衣服，
I decide to the wind,
Breathe in the menthol-cool air,
LA traffic, so small from way up here,
the cloudless sunset,
one eye out for the green bloom of afterglow,
one eye looking back.

Gripping my jacket, 
I bear my heart out to the wind.
让它刮把 let it scrape，
scrape, scrape, scrape.
